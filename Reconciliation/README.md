#Setup
Download the latest version of python 3 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  
Download all of the files that I sent you and store them all in the
same directory:

The files are:

reconciliation.py\
tests.py\
recon.in\
README.md

#Run Program
To run reconciliation.py, first open terminal/command line and navigate to the directory
in which the files are saved.

$ cd path/to/the/directory

Run reconciliation.py by using the command line/terminal:

$ python reconciliation.py -f 'recon.in'

recon.in is the input file that will be read

"-f" specifies that recon.in is the filename

You can also open reconciliation.py and run the program through from the IDE.

$ open reconciliation.py

To run the tests, open tests.py and run it from the IDE. Make sure that
tests.py is stored in the same directory as reconciliation.py.

$ open tests.py
